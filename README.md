# Warrior Game üïπÔ∏è

## 1. Project Description
**Warrior Game** is a text-based battle game where players create a character, choose a class, and engage in combat with an Evil Wizard. The game features turn-based mechanics, special abilities unique to each class, and strategic gameplay that encourages decision-making.

### What Does the Application Do?
- Allows players to select a class (Warrior, Mage, Archer, or Paladin) with unique abilities.
- Engages players in a battle with the Evil Wizard.
- Incorporates healing and special moves to enhance strategy.

### Why Use These Technologies?
This project was built using Python because:
- Python's simplicity makes it beginner-friendly for text-based games.
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) allows for clean, modular design with reusable code for characters and abilities.

### Challenges Faced
- Incorporating automatic turn based attacks.
- Implementing special abilities.
- Making the code simple but functional.

### Possible Features to Implement in the Future
- Add a level-up system for characters.
- Create multiple opponents with varying difficulty levels.
- Implement multiplayer functionality.
- Add a graphical interface using `pygame`.
